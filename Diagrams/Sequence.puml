== Connection and State Request ==
Sensor -> Server: Connect to server
Sensor -> Server: Request states (GET_STATES)
Server -> Sensor: Send available states (STATE_RED, STATE_YELLOW, STATE_GREEN, STATE_BLUE)

== Distance Measurement and State Sending ==
loop Distance Measurement (every 100ms)
  Sensor -> Sensor: Measure distance
  alt distance < 15 cm
    Sensor -> Sensor: Set STATE_RED
  else distance ≥ 15 cm and distance < 25 cm
    Sensor -> Sensor: Set STATE_YELLOW
  else distance ≥ 25 cm and distance < 40 cm
    Sensor -> Sensor: Set STATE_GREEN
  else distance ≥ 40 cm
    Sensor -> Sensor: Set STATE_BLUE
  end
  
  alt New state detected
    Sensor -> Server: Send new state (e.g., STATE_RED)
    
    Server -> Actuator: Forward state to Actuator
    Actuator -> Actuator: Act on received state (e.g., turn on red LED)
  else No change in state
    Sensor -> Sensor: Continue without sending state
  end
end
